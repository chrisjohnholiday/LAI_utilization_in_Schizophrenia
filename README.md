Abstract:

With non-adherence being the biggest factor in treatment failure for schizophrenia, long acting injectable (LAI) antipsychotic medication brings with it the promise of improved health outcomes for patients suffering from schizophrenia. This paper analyzes the health outcomes of patients with schizophrenia covered by Medicaid by looking at the changes in hospital admission rates, their average length of stay in the hospital and the average charge the patient receives for their stay. The goal is to examine if improvements in health outcomes for schizophrenia can be observed with an increase in the use of LAIs as a treatment. A differences-in-differences fixed effects model is used to estimate the changes in these health outcomes in response to LAI reimbursement in states across the United States. We conclude that hospitalization rates are not affected by an increase in LAI reimbursement, that the average length of stay is moderately impacted, and that hospital charge is significantly impacted by the usage of LAIs.
